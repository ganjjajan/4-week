        <h2>Happy Birthday!</h2>
        <p>Ahead of Tsubu's first birthday, our family wanted to give him special memories. We decided to make a birthday cake that even dogs can eat!<br>
        <img src="cake.PNG"  width="800" height="300"></p>
        <p>I looked for a custom-made store, made a design of a cake, and requested it to be made. <br>The cake was successful, and Tsubu smiled happily at the sweet taste he had never tasted before. A cake was a large amount for a young puppy to eat, so it was divided into the freezer and could be eaten for a very long time.</p>

            <p>Our family tried to leave many good memories in Tsubu's short life. So we planned several trips just for him. <br>We got a pension in the forest, walked in the dewy forest, and tasted salty water in the sea breeze. And I went on an island trip by boat and showed and experienced many things to Tsubu. It may have actually given him a feeling of happiness, but his face in our eyes looked happy.</p></p>
